This repository demonstrates two uncommon yet significant errors that can occur in HTML. The first example shows how trying to access a non-existent attribute using getAttribute() will return null.  This might not immediately cause an error but could lead to unexpected behavior in your application if not handled properly. The second example highlights the critical security risk of directly using user-supplied data within innerHTML, as it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The solution file provides safer ways to handle attribute access and data insertion.
